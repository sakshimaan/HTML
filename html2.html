<p style = "color:#254117">HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.</p>
<p style = "color:#254117"><b>The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.</b>
<ol>
<li><i>HyperText</i> is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called <b>hyperlinks</b> which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.</li>
<li><i>Markup</i> is what <b>HTML tags</b> do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).</li>
<li>HTML is a <i>Language</i>, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</li>
</ol></p>
<h4><b>How does it work?</b><hr align ="center" width = "100%">
<p style = "color:#254117">HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.</br></p>
<h4><b>What are tags upto?</b><hr align ="center" width = "100%">
<p style = "color:#254117">The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. You might know them as the words between the <angle-brackets>. They allow all the cool stuff like images and tables and stuff, just by telling your browser what to render on the page. Different tags will perform different functions. The tags themselves don’t appear when you view your page through a browser, but their effects do.</br> </p>
